Democracy is evil and infantile, especially when used properly. It is the easies system ever designed by man. They complicate it by counting numbers after a vote, but that is just smoke and mirrors for retards.

All these morons worship democracy. THey all take a vote. THey are mostly retarded. They can only count up to 100 in some democracies. Most democraies are controlled by a less than 0.5% margin.
